I logged into login.engin.umich.edu, and uploaded my source code to a new directory Private/p0. This directory contained the the exact set of .h and .cpp files that I wanted to submit. 

-bash-4.2$ cd p0
-bash-4.2$ ls
Collection.cpp  p0_main.cpp  Record.h     Utility.h
Collection.h    Record.cpp   Utility.cpp

After setting up the proper version of gcc, I did a build to check that all files needed were present: 

-bash-4.2$ g++ -std=c++14 -pedantic-errors *.cpp

I also uploaded the samples and my other test files to that same directory and used I/O redirection and diff or sdiff to check that on the engin platform my program appeared to be working correctly. One such check:

-bash-4.2$ ./a.out <normal_in.txt >test_out.txt
-bash-4.2$ sdiff normal_out.txt test_out.txt

*** Important *** If you changed *anything at all* in your code, you should assume it is broken! Perform the above test build and at least some I/O redirection checks before submitting your modified code!

Then after checking again to be sure that I had no extraneous .h or .cpp files present, I submitted all of the .h and .cpp files with wild cards, thus making sure that I got everything included. If you leave a file out, the build will fail, and you waste the submission! Notice exactly what the response of the submission script is. 

--------------------

-bash-4.2$ ls *.h
Collection.h  Record.h  Utility.h
-bash-4.2$ ls *.cpp
Collection.cpp  p0_main.cpp  Record.cpp  Utility.cpp
-bash-4.2$ submit381 0 *.h *.cpp

You are about to submit the following files:
	Collection.h
	Record.h
	Utility.h
	Collection.cpp
	p0_main.cpp
	Record.cpp
	Utility.cpp

Submit these files? Type y or RETURN to submit, anything else to abort: y
Connecting directly to eecs381@grader8.eecs.umich.edu

Mailed:	Collection.h
	Record.h
	Utility.h
	Collection.cpp
	p0_main.cpp
	Record.cpp
	Utility.cpp

You should receive an email acknowledgement from eecs381@grader8.eecs.umich.edu
for this submission.  Look over the acknowledgement to make sure you submitted
the correct source code file(s) (e.g. that it's not the object or executable
file, etc.).
-bash-4.2$ 

------------------

If you don't see this output, something is wrong (for example, maybe the software on the machine isn't complete). Try a different machine or email us for help. If everything is OK, you should get an email sent to your uniqname@umich.edu with the autograder response. When the load is heavy, this can take several minutes. Review the other web pages about the autograder and how to deal with it. 

*** It is most important not to submit again until you have received a response. ***
If the response seems to be badly delayed, send to eecs381help.
