0 Strings using 0 bytes

Watch them go in and out of scope
in test_fn1:
Ctor: "Good morning!"
Ctor: "Good night!"
Good morning!Good night!
2 Strings using 26 bytes
Dtor: "Good night!"
Dtor: "Good morning!"
0 Strings using 0 bytes

Demonstrate initialization and copy and move construction
Initialize a with String a = "Hello";
Ctor: "Hello"
Move ctor: "Hello"
Dtor: ""
Construct b from a
Copy ctor: "Hello"
Construct c from a + b
Copy ctor: "Hello"
Move ctor: "HelloHello"
Dtor: ""
Move ctor: "HelloHello"
Dtor: ""
a:Hello b:Hello c:HelloHello
Construct d from function return value
in test_fn2
Ctor: "xxx"
test_fn2 returning: xxx
Move ctor: "xxx"
Dtor: ""
Move ctor: "xxx"
Dtor: ""
d:xxx
4 Strings using 38 bytes
Dtor: "xxx"
Dtor: "HelloHello"
Dtor: "Hello"
Dtor: "Hello"

Demonstrate assignment operators
Ctor: ""
Ctor: ""
Ctor: ""
Assign from a C-string
Assign from C-string:  "Good Morning!"
Ctor: "Good Morning!"
Dtor: ""
Assign from another String
Copy assign from String:  "Good Morning!"
Copy ctor: "Good Morning!"
Dtor: ""
Assign from a + b
Copy ctor: "Good Morning!"
Move ctor: "Good Morning!Good Morning!"
Dtor: ""
Move assign from String:  "Good Morning!Good Morning!"
Dtor: ""
a:Good Morning! b:Good Morning! c:Good Morning!Good Morning!
3 Strings using 82 bytes
Dtor: "Good Morning!Good Morning!"
Dtor: "Good Morning!"
Dtor: "Good Morning!"

Demonstrate call and return by value
Ctor: "initial a"
Ctor: "initial b"
Ctor: "initial c"
Call a function with a call-by-value argument that returns that same variable
Copy ctor: "initial a"
test_fn3 got:initial a
4 Strings using 40 bytes
Assign from C-string:  "!!!"
Ctor: "!!!"
Dtor: "initial a"
test_fn3 returning: !!!
4 Strings using 34 bytes
Move ctor: "!!!"
Move assign from String:  "!!!"
Dtor: "initial b"
Dtor: ""
function call result: !!!
Call the same function with an argument of a + b
Copy ctor: "initial a"
Move ctor: "initial a!!!"
Dtor: ""
Move ctor: "initial a!!!"
test_fn3 got:initial a!!!
5 Strings using 50 bytes
Assign from C-string:  "!!!"
Ctor: "!!!"
Dtor: "initial a!!!"
test_fn3 returning: !!!
5 Strings using 28 bytes
Move ctor: "!!!"
Move assign from String:  "!!!"
Dtor: "initial c"
Dtor: ""
Dtor: ""
function call result: !!!
a:initial a b:!!! c:!!!
3 Strings using 18 bytes
Dtor: "!!!"
Dtor: "!!!"
Dtor: "initial a"

Demonstrate move construction and assignment using std::move
Ctor: "aaa"
a has aaa
1 Strings using 4 bytes
move construct b from a
Move ctor: "aaa"
a now has "", b has "aaa"
2 Strings using 4 bytes
now move assign a from b
Move assign from String:  "aaa"
a now has "aaa", b has ""
2 Strings using 4 bytes
Dtor: ""
Dtor: "aaa"

Demonstrate swaping
Ctor: "aaa"
Ctor: "bbb"
2 Strings using 8 bytes
a now has "aaa", b has "bbb"
let's swap their guts with String::swap!
a now has "bbb", b has "aaa"
let's swap their guts back with std::swap which uses std::move through a temporary String!
Move ctor: "bbb"
Move assign from String:  "aaa"
Move assign from String:  "bbb"
Dtor: ""
a now has "aaa", b has "bbb"
2 Strings using 8 bytes
Dtor: "bbb"
Dtor: "aaa"
