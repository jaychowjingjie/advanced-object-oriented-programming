# Advanced Object Oriented Programming
This was one of the most intensive and technical programming courses that I took, as an undergraduate, during the Winter 2017 semester at the University of Michigan College of Engineering. My professor, David Kieras, has since retired from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor but I am grateful for his teachings and advice from EECS381. Projects 4, 5 and 6 consist of only starter code and template files for the open source community to build on
