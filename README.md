# Advanced Object Oriented Programming
This was one of the most intensive and technical programming courses that I took in Winter 2017 at the University of Michigan College of Engineering as an undergraduate. My professor, David Kieras, has since retired from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor but I am forever grateful for his teachings and advice from EECS381. Projects 4, 5 and 6 consist of only starter and template files.
