# Advanced Object Oriented Programming
This was one of the most intensive and technical programming courses that I took in Winter 2017 at the University of Michigan College of Engineering as an undergraduate. My professor, David Kieras, has retired from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor but I am grateful for his teachings and advice from this course.
